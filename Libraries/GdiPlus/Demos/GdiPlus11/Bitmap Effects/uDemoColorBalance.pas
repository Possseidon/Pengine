/// The ColorBalance class enables you to change the color balance (relative
/// amounts of red, green, and blue) of a bitmap. The effect has 3 parameters:
///  1. CyanRed (-100..100): If the value is 0, there is no change. As the value
/// moves from 0 to 100, the amount of red in the image increases and the amount
/// of cyan decreases. As the value moves from 0 to -100, the amount of red in
/// the image decreases and the amount of cyan increases.
///  2. MagentaGreen (-100..100): If the value is 0, there is no change. As the
/// value moves from 0 to 100, the amount of green in the image increases and the
/// amount of magenta decreases. As the value moves from 0 to -100, the amount of
/// green in the image decreases and the amount of magenta increases.
///  3. YellowBlue (-100..100): If the value is 0, there is no change. As the
/// value moves from 0 to 100, the amount of blue in the image increases and the
/// amount of yellow decreases. As the value moves from 0 to -100, the amount of
/// blue in the image decreases and the amount of yellow increases.
