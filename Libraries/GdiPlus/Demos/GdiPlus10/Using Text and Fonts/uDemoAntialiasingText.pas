/// Microsoft Windows GDI+ provides various quality levels for drawing text.
/// Typically, higher quality rendering takes more processing time than lower
/// quality rendering.
///
/// The quality level is a property of the <A>IGPGraphics</A> class. To set the
/// quality level, set the <A>TextRenderingHint</A> method of a <A>IGPGraphics</A>
/// object. The <A>TextRenderingHint</A> property receives one of the elements
/// of the <A>TTextRenderingHint</A> enumeration.
///
/// GDI+ provides traditional antialiasing and a new kind of antialiasing based
/// on Microsoft ClearType display technology only available on Windows XP and
/// Windows Server 2003 and later. ClearType smoothing improves readability on
/// color LCD monitors that have a digital interface, such as the monitors in
/// laptops and high-quality flat desktop displays. Readability on CRT screens
/// is also somewhat improved.
///
/// ClearType is dependent on the orientation and ordering of the LCD stripes.
/// Currently, ClearType is implemented only for vertical stripes that are
/// ordered RGB. This might be a concern if you are using a tablet PC, where the
/// display can be oriented in any direction, or if you are using a screen that
/// can be turned from landscape to portrait.
///
/// The following example draws text with two different quality settings.
