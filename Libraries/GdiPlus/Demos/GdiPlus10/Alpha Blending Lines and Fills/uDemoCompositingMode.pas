/// There might be times when you want to create an off-screen bitmap that has
/// the following characteristics:
///
///  -Colors have alpha values that are less than 255.
///  -Colors are not alpha blended with each other as you create the bitmap.
///  -When you display the finished bitmap, colors in the bitmap are alpha
/// blended with the background colors on the display device.
///
/// To create such a bitmap, construct a blank <A>IGPBitmap</A> object, and then
/// construct a <A>IGPGraphics</A> object based on that bitmap. Set the
/// compositing mode of the <A>IGPGraphics</A> object to CompositingModeSourceCopy.
///
/// The following example creates a <A>IGPGraphics</A> object based on a
/// <A>IGPBitmap</A> object. The code uses the <A>IGPGraphics</A> object along with
/// two semitransparent brushes (alpha = 160) to paint on the bitmap. The code
/// fills a red ellipse and a green ellipse using the semitransparent brushes.
/// The green ellipse overlaps the red ellipse, but the green is not blended
/// with the red because the compositing mode of the <A>IGPGraphics</A> object is
/// set to CompositingModeSourceCopy.
///
/// The code draws the bitmap on the screen twice: once on a white background
/// and once on a multicolored background. The pixels in the bitmap that are
/// part of the two ellipses have an alpha component of 160, so the ellipses are
/// blended with the background colors on the screen.
