/// The rectangle is larger than the path used to define the brush, so some of
/// the rectangle is not painted by the brush. The 4th illustration above shows

///
/// <H>Customizing a Path Gradient</H>
/// One way to customize a path gradient brush is to set its focus scales. The
/// focus scales specify an inner path that lies inside the main path. The
/// center color is displayed everywhere inside that inner path rather than only
/// at the center point. To set the focus scales of a path gradient brush, call
/// the <A>SetFocusScales</A> method.
///
/// The following example creates a path gradient brush based on an elliptical
/// path. The code sets the boundary color to blue, sets the center color to
/// aqua, and then uses the path gradient brush to fill the elliptical path.
///
/// Next the code sets the focus scales of the path gradient brush. The x focus
/// scale is set to 0.3, and the y focus scale is set to 0.8. The code calls the
/// <A>TranslateTransform</A> method of a <A>IGPGraphics</A> object so that the
/// subsequent call to <A>FillPath</A> fills an ellipse that sits to the right
/// of the first ellipse.
///
/// To see the effect of the focus scales, imagine a small ellipse that shares
/// its center with the main ellipse. The small (inner) ellipse is the main
/// ellipse scaled (about its center) horizontally by a factor of 0.3 and
/// vertically by a factor of 0.8. As you move from the boundary of the outer
/// ellipse to the boundary of the inner ellipse, the color changes gradually
/// from blue to aqua. As you move from the boundary of the inner ellipse to the
/// shared center, the color remains aqua.

/// The fifth illustration above (the first on the 2nd row) shows the output of

/// preset colors and an array of interpolation positions.
///
/// The following example creates a path gradient brush based on a triangle. The
/// code sets the <A>IGPPathGradientBrush.InterpolationColors</A> property of the
/// path gradient brush to specify an array of interpolation colors (dark green,
/// aqua, blue) and an array of interpolation positions (0, 0.25, 1). As you
