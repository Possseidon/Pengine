/// With a few minor adjustments to your code, you can send Microsoft Windows

/// obtain a device context handle for the printer and pass that handle to a
/// <A>TGPGraphics</A> constructor. Place your GDI+ drawing commands in between
/// calls to <A>StartDoc</A> and <A>EndDoc</A>.
///
/// One way to get a device context handle for a printer is to display a print
/// dialog box and allow the user to choose a printer.

/// The following example draws a line, a rectangle, and an ellipse on the
/// printer selected in the print dialog box. Click on the "Print" button above
/// to execute the example.
