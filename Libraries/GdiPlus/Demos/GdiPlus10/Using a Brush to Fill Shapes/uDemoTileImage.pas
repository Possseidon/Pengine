/// Just as tiles can be placed next to each other to cover a floor, rectangular
/// images can be placed next to each other to fill (tile) a shape. To tile the
/// interior of a shape, use a texture brush. When you construct a
/// <A>IGPTextureBrush</A> object, one of the arguments you pass to the
/// constructor is an <A>IGPImage</A> object. When you use the texture brush to
/// paint the interior of a shape, the shape is filled with repeated copies of
/// this image.
///
/// The wrap mode property of the <A>IGPTextureBrush</A> object determines how the
/// image is oriented as it is repeated in a rectangular grid. You can make all
/// the tiles in the grid have the same orientation, or you can make the image
/// flip from one grid position to the next. The flipping can be horizontal,
/// vertical, or both. The following examples demonstrate tiling with different
/// types of flipping.
