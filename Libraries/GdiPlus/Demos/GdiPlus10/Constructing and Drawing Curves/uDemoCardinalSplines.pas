/// GDI+ supports several types of curves: ellipses, arcs, cardinal splines, and
/// Bézier splines. An ellipse is defined by its bounding rectangle; an arc is a
/// portion of an ellipse defined by a starting angle and a sweep angle. A
/// cardinal spline is defined by an array of points and a tension parameter —
/// the curve passes smoothly through each point in the array, and the tension
/// parameter influences the way the curve bends. A Bézier spline is defined by
/// two end points and two control points — the curve does not pass through the
/// control points, but the control points influence the direction and bend as
/// the curve goes from one end point to the other.
///
/// A cardinal spline is a curve that passes smoothly through a given set of
/// points. To draw a cardinal spline, create a <A>IGPGraphics</A> object and pass
/// an array of points to the <A>DrawCurve</A> method. The following example
/// draws a bell-shaped cardinal spline that passes through five designated
/// points:
