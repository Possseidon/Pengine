/// To draw a line in Microsoft Windows GDI+ you need a <A>IGPGraphics</A> object,

/// object provides the <A>IGPGraphics.DrawLine</A> method, and the <A>IGPPen</A>
/// object holds attributes of the line, such as color and width. The <A>IGPPen</A>

/// The following code draws a line from (0, 0) to (200, 100). The argument
/// passed to the <A>TGPPen</A> constructor is a reference to a <A>TGPColor</A>
/// record. The four numbers passed to the color constructor represent the
/// alpha, red, green, and blue components of the color. The alpha component
/// determines the transparency of the color; 0 is fully transparent and 255 is
/// fully opaque. The four numbers passed to the <A>IGPGraphics.DrawLine</A>
/// method represent the starting point (0, 0) and the ending point (200, 100)
