/// A path is a sequence of graphics primitives (lines, rectangles, curves,
/// text, and the like) that can be manipulated and drawn as a single unit. A
/// path can be divided into figures that are either open or closed. A figure
/// can contain several primitives.
///
/// You can draw a path by calling the <A>DrawPath</A> method of the
/// <A>IGPGraphics</A> interface, and you can fill a path by calling the
/// <A>FillPath</A> method of the <A>IGPGraphics</A> interface.
///
/// To create a path, construct a <A>IGPGraphicsPath</A> object, and then call
/// methods, such as <A>AddLine</A> and <A>AddCurve</A>, to add primitives to
/// the path.
///
/// The following example creates a path that has a single arc. The arc has a
/// sweep angle of –180 degrees, which is counterclockwise in the default
/// coordinate system (see the illustration above with the red pen).

/// The following example creates a path that has two figures. The first figure
/// is an arc followed by a line. The second figure is a line followed by a
/// curve, followed by a line. The first figure is left open, and the second
/// figure is closed (see the illustration above with the blue pen).

/// In addition to adding lines and curves to paths, you can add closed shapes:
/// rectangles, ellipses, pies, and polygons. The following example creates a
/// path that has two lines, a rectangle, and an ellipse. The code uses a pen to
/// draw the path and a brush to fill the path (see the illustration above with
/// the green pen).
