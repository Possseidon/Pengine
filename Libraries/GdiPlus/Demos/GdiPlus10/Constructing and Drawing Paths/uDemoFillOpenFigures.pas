/// You can fill a path by passing a <A>IGPGraphicsPath</A> object to the
/// <A>IGPGraphics.FillPath</A> method. The <A>FillPath</A> method fills the path
/// according to the fill mode (alternate or winding) currently set for the
/// path. If the path has any open figures, the path is filled as if those
/// figures were closed. GDI+ closes a figure by drawing a straight line from
/// its ending point to its starting point.
///
/// The following example creates a path that has one open figure (an arc) and
/// one closed figure (an ellipse). The <A>IGPGraphics.FillPath</A> method fills
/// the path according to the default fill mode, which is
/// <A>FillModeAlternate</A>.
