/// Microsoft Windows GDI+ provides several dash styles that are listed in the
/// <A>TDashStyle</A> enumeration. If those standard dash styles don't suit your
/// needs, you can create a custom dash pattern.
///
/// To draw a custom dashed line, put the lengths of the dashes and spaces in an
/// array and pass the array as an argument to the <A>SetDashPattern</A> method
/// of a <A>IGPPen</A> object. The following example draws a custom dashed line
/// based on the array [5, 2, 15, 4]. If you multiply the elements of the array
/// by the pen width of 5, you get [25, 10, 75, 20].
/// The displayed dashes alternate in length between 25 and 75, and the spaces
/// alternate in length between 10 and 20.
