/// Instead of drawing a line or curve with a solid color, you can draw with a
/// texture. To draw lines and curves with a texture, create a
/// <A>IGPTextureBrush</A> object, and pass that <A>IGPTextureBrush</A> object to a
/// <A>TGPPen</A> constructor. The image associated with the texture brush is used
/// to tile the plane (invisibly), and when the pen draws a line or curve, the
/// stroke of the pen uncovers certain pixels of the tiled texture.
///
/// The following example creates an <A>IGPImage</A> object from the file
/// Texture1.jpg. That image is used to construct a <A>IGPTextureBrush</A> object,
/// and the <A>IGPTextureBrush</A> object is used to construct a <A>IGPPen</A>
/// object. The call to <A>IGPGraphics.DrawImage</A> draws the image with its
/// upper-left corner at (0, 0). The call to <A>Graphics.DrawEllipse</A> uses
/// the <A>IGPPen</A> object to draw a textured ellipse.
