/// Recoloring is the process of adjusting image colors. Some examples of
/// recoloring are changing one color to another, adjusting a color's intensity
/// relative to another color, adjusting the brightness or contrast of all
/// colors, and converting colors to shades of gray.
///
/// Microsoft Windows GDI+ provides the <A>IGPImage</A> and <A>IGPBitmap</A>
/// interfacing for storing and manipulating images. <A>IGPImage</A> and
/// <A>IGPBitmap</A> objects store the color of each pixel as a 32-bit number:
/// 8 bits each for red, green, blue, and alpha. Each of the four components is
/// a number from 0 through 255, with 0 representing no intensity and 255
/// representing full intensity. The alpha component specifies the transparency
/// of the color: 0 is fully transparent, and 255 is fully opaque.
///
/// A color vector is a 4-tuple of the form (red, green, blue, alpha). For
/// example, the color vector (0, 255, 0, 255) represents an opaque color that
/// has no red or blue, but has green at full intensity.
///
/// Another convention for representing colors uses the number 1 for maximum
/// intensity and the number 0 for minimum intensity. Using that convention, the
/// color described in the preceding paragraph would be represented by the
/// vector (0, 1, 0, 1). GDI+ uses the convention of 1 as full intensity when it
/// performs color transformations.
///
/// You can apply linear transformations (rotation, scaling, and the like) to
/// color vectors by multiplying by a 4×4 matrix. However, you cannot use a 4×4
/// matrix to perform a translation (nonlinear). If you add a dummy fifth
/// coordinate (for example, the number 1) to each of the color vectors, you can
/// use a 5×5 matrix to apply any combination of linear transformations and
/// translations. A transformation consisting of a linear transformation
/// followed by a translation is called an affine transformation. A 5×5 matrix
/// that represents an affine transformation is called a homogeneous matrix for
/// a 4-space transformation. The element in the fifth row and fifth column of a
/// 5×5 homogeneous matrix must be 1, and all of the other entries in the fifth
/// column must be 0.
///
/// For example, suppose you want to start with the color (0.2, 0.0, 0.4, 1.0)
/// and apply the following transformations:
///
///  -Double the red component
///  -Add 0.2 to the red, green, and blue components
///
/// The following matrix multiplication will perform the pair of transformations
/// in the order listed.
///
///  | 2.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 |
///  | 0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 |
///  | 0.0  0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0 |
///  | 0.0  0.0  0.0  1.0  0.0 |
///  | 0.2  0.2  0.2  0.0  1.0 |
///
/// The elements of a color matrix are indexed (zero-based) by row and then
/// column. For example, the entry in the fifth row and third column of matrix
/// M is denoted by M[4,2].
///
/// The 5×5 identity matrix has 1s on the diagonal and 0s everywhere else. If
/// you multiply a color vector by the identity matrix, the color vector does
/// not change. A convenient way to form the matrix of a color transformation is
/// to start with the identity matrix and make a small change that produces the
/// desired transformation.
///
/// For a more detailed discussion of matrices and transformations, see the
/// topic <A>Coordinate Systems and Transformations</A> in the Platform SDK.
///
/// The following example takes an image that is all one color
/// (0.2, 0.0, 0.4, 1.0) and applies the transformation described in the
/// preceding paragraphs.
