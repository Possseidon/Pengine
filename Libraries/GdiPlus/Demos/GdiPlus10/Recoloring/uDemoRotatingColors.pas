/// Rotation in a four-dimensional color space is difficult to visualize. We can
/// make it easier to visualize rotation by agreeing to keep one of the color
/// components fixed. Suppose we agree to keep the alpha component fixed at 1
/// (fully opaque). Then we can visualize a three-dimensional color space with
/// red, green, and blue axes as shown in the following illustration.
///
///  <I>See the Platform SDK topic "Rotating Colors" for the illustration</I>
///
/// A color can be thought of as a point in 3-D space. For example, the point
/// (1, 0, 0) in space represents the color red, and the point (0, 1, 0) in
/// space represents the color green.
///
/// The following illustration shows what it means to rotate the color (1, 0, 0)
/// through an angle of 60 degrees in the Red-Green plane. Rotation in a plane
/// parallel to the Red-Green plane can be thought of as rotation about the blue
/// axis.
///
///  <I>See the Platform SDK topic "Rotating Colors" for the illustration</I>
///
/// The following illustration shows how to initialize a color matrix to perform
/// rotations about each of the three coordinate axes (red, green, blue).
///
///  <I>See the Platform SDK topic "Rotating Colors" for the illustration</I>
///
/// The following example takes an image that is all one color (1, 0, 0.6) and
/// applies a 60-degree rotation about the blue axis. The angle of the rotation
/// is swept out in a plane that is parallel to the Red-Green plane.
