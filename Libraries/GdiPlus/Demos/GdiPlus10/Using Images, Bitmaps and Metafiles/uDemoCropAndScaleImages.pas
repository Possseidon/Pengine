/// The <A>IGPGraphics</A> interface provides several <A>DrawImage</A> methods,
/// some of which have source and destination rectangle parameters that you can
/// use to crop and scale images.
///
/// The following example constructs an <A>IGPImage</A> object from the file
/// Apple.gif. The code draws the entire apple image in its original size. The
/// code then calls the <A>DrawImage</A> method of a <A>IGPGraphics</A> object to
/// draw a portion of the apple image in a destination rectangle that is larger
/// than the original apple image.
///
/// The <A>DrawImage</A> method determines which portion of the apple to draw by
/// looking at the source rectangle, which is specified by the third, fourth,
/// fifth, and sixth arguments. In this case, the apple is cropped to 75 percent
/// of its width and 75 percent of its height.
///
/// The <A>DrawImage</A> method determines where to draw the cropped apple and
/// how big to make the cropped apple by looking at the destination rectangle,
/// which is specified by the second argument. In this case, the destination
/// rectangle is 30 percent wider and 30 percent taller than the original image.
