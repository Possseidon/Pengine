/// The <A>IGPMetafile</A> interface, which inherits from the <A>IGPImage</A>
/// interface, allows you to record a sequence of drawing commands. The recorded
/// commands can be stored in memory, saved to a file, or saved to a stream.
/// Metafiles can contain vector graphics, raster images, and text.
///
/// The following example creates a <A>IGPMetafile</A> object. The code uses the
/// <A>IGPMetafile</A> object to record a sequence of graphics commands and then
/// saves the recorded commands in a file named SampleMetafileRecording.emf.
/// Note that the <A>TGPMetafile</A> constructor receives a device context handle,
/// and the <A>TGPGraphics</A> constructor receives the <A>IGPMetafile</A> object.
/// The recording stops (and the recorded commands are saved to the file) when
/// the <A>IGPGraphics</A> object goes out of scope. The last line of code display
/// the metafile by passing the <A>IGPMetafile</A> object to the <A>DrawImage</A>
/// method of the <A>IGPGraphics</A> object. Note that the code uses the same
/// <A>IGPMetafile</A> object to record and to display (play back) the metafile.
