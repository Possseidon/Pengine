/// A single <A>IGPMatrix</A> object can store a single transformation or a
/// sequence of transformations. The latter is called a composite
/// transformation. The matrix of a composite transformation is obtained by
/// multiplying the matrices of the individual transformations.
///
/// In a composite transformation, the order of the individual transformations
/// is important. For example, if you first rotate, then scale, then translate,
/// you get a different result than if you first translate, then rotate, then
/// scale. In Microsoft Windows GDI+, composite transformations are built from
/// left to right. If S, R, and T are scale, rotation, and translation matrices
/// respectively, then the product SRT (in that order) is the matrix of the
/// composite transformation that first scales, then rotates, then translates.
/// The matrix produced by the product SRT is different from the matrix produced
/// by the product TRS.
///
/// One reason order is significant is that transformations like rotation and
/// scaling are done with respect to the origin of the coordinate system.
/// Scaling an object that is centered at the origin produces a different result
/// than scaling an object that has been moved away from the origin. Similarly,
/// rotating an object that is centered at the origin produces a different
/// result than rotating an object that has been moved away from the origin.
///
/// The following example combines scaling, rotation and translation (in that
/// order) to form a composite transformation. The argument
/// <A>MatrixOrderAppend</A> passed to the <A>RotateTransform</A> method
/// specifies that the rotation will follow the scaling. Likewise, the argument
/// <A>MatrixOrderAppend</A> passed to the <A>TranslateTransform</A> method
/// specifies that the translation will follow the rotation. The result is
/// drawn in red.

end;

/// The following example makes the same method calls as the previous example,
/// but the order of the calls is reversed. The resulting order of operations is
/// first translate, then rotate, then scale, which produces a very different
/// result than first scale, then rotate, then translate. The result is drawn
/// in green.

/// One way to reverse the order of the individual transformations in a
/// composite transformation is to reverse the order of a sequence of method
/// calls. A second way to control the order of operations is to change the
/// matrix order argument. The following example is the same as the previous
/// example, except that MatrixOrderAppend has been changed to
/// MatrixOrderPrepend. The matrix multiplication is done in the order SRT,
/// where S, R, and T are the matrices for scale, rotate, and translate,
/// respectively. The order of the composite transformation is first scale, then
/// rotate, then translate. The result in drawn in yellow.

/// The result of the preceding example is the same result that we achieved in

/// the red rectangle). This is because we reversed both the order of the method
